Our alternative scorecard rewards companies for real impact: job creation, skills development, and poverty reduction. This is the heart of our six-point economic plan — dismantling the barriers that actually block growth, including the BBBEE Act and Employment Equity Act.\n\nIt's time for transformation based on need, not patronage.

Our Economic Inclusion for All Bill challenges the race-based BEE system that has enriched ANC cadres while leaving millions behind.\n\nOur approach is simple: reward value for money and genuine social impact. The new scorecard allocates 80% for cost-effectiveness and technical capacity, and 20% for measurable contributions to UN Sustainable Development Goals — jobs created, skills developed, poverty reduced.\n\nWith 12 million South Africans unemployed, we can't afford to maintain a system that prioritises patronage over productivity.

The results? 44 million South Africans trapped in poverty, 12 million unemployed, and a small elite of politically connected individuals turned into billionaires. This isn't transformation — it's the entrenchment of inequality under a new guise.\n\nThe DA has said enough is enough. In October 2025, we gazetted the Economic Inclusion for All Bill, which fundamentally reforms public procurement by replacing all race-based preferences with need-based empowerment. Our alternative scorecard allocates 80% of evaluation points to value for money — assessing cost-effectiveness, technical capacity, and reliability — and 20% to genuine economic inclusion measured against UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis means companies will be rewarded for demonstrable contributions to job creation, skills development, poverty reduction, environmental sustainability, and good governance. Not for ticking racial boxes or having connections to the right politicians.\n\nThe Economic Inclusion Bill is part of the DA's six-point plan to turbocharge the economy, which also demands dismantling the BBBEE Act and Employment Equity Act — two major legislative barriers that deter investment and block small businesses from opportunities.\n\nThe DA's approach aligns with Section 217 of the Constitution and international best practice.

Currently, race-based BEE has left 44 million South Africans — predominantly Black — trapped in poverty while creating a small class of politically connected billionaires. After more than 20 years, the model has failed those it claimed to empower.\n\nThe DA's alternative replaces race with need as the basis for empowerment. Our scorecard rewards companies for measurable social impact: job creation, skills development, poverty reduction, environmental sustainability, and good governance. This approach focuses resources where they're most needed rather than where political connections dictate.\n\nGovernance track record: Most compelling is what happens where the DA actually governs. Our municipalities deliver superior service outcomes to all communities compared to ANC-run counterparts. Clean water flows in townships and suburbs. Electricity works reliably for everyone. Refuse collection happens consistently. Roads get maintained. Infrastructure functions. Service delivery data consistently shows DA-governed areas outperforming others on metrics that matter — metrics that benefit communities historically disadvantaged by poor service delivery.\n\nOne South Africa for All is operational, not aspirational: opportunity for everyone based on need and merit; government that serves all citizens with competence and integrity; transformation that creates jobs rather than enriching elites; service delivery that reaches every community. Our record demonstrates this. One South Africa for All."

The results are clear: 44 million South Africans remain in poverty (predominantly black South Africans); 12 million are unemployed; a small class of politically connected individuals became billionaires; investment has been deterred by uncertainty and compliance costs; and economic growth has stagnated.\n\nIf this is 'transformation,' it's transformation that has failed the people it claimed to serve.\n\nThe DA's alternative — need-based transformation:\n\nThe DA's Economic Inclusion for All Bill, gazetted in October 2025, replaces race-based preferences with need-based empowerment.

Reliable clean water, functional electricity, collected refuse, and maintained infrastructure transform lives — and matter most to communities that historically lacked them.\n\nThe DA supports transformation that works — creating opportunity, reducing poverty, delivering services, building inclusive institutions.

Defending this as 'successful transformation' requires ignoring 44 million people in poverty.\n\nThe DA's alternative framework:\n\nOur Economic Inclusion for All Bill, gazetted October 2025, proposes transformation measured by actual outcomes. Our scorecard evaluates companies on: human development (education, healthcare, social welfare contributions); economic empowerment (job creation, skills development, SMME support, wage practices); environmental sustainability; inclusive communities; and good governance.\n\nThis rewards companies for what they contribute to society — jobs created, people trained, poverty reduced, communities supported.

Political elites seeking enrichment through connections.\n\nWhy need rather than race:\n\nThe DA uses poverty and need as the basis for identifying disadvantage rather than using race as a permanent proxy.

These improvements matter most to communities that can't afford private alternatives.\n\nThe DA supports transformation that achieves its stated goals: expanding opportunity, reducing poverty, delivering services, building inclusive institutions.
